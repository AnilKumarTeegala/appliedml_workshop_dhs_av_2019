Have you ever wondered how to apply machine learning to business problems? This workshop is specially designed to help learn the concepts, tools and techniques involved. You will go through real-life case studies and experience how this is done in the industry. The focus of this workshop will be on the machine learning pipeline data cleaning, feature engineering, model building and evaluation. You will also learn how to structure a business problem as an ML problem, and then go on to build, select and evaluate the model.
